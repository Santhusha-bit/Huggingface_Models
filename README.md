## ðŸ“¦ Contents

- `simpleMain.py` â€“ Pre-downloaded or referenced Hugging Face model checkpoints  
- `complexmain.py` â€“ Python scripts demonstrating how to use each model  
- `requirements.txt` â€“ Python dependencies  

---

## ðŸš€ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Santhusha-bit/Huggingface_Models.git
cd Huggingface_Models
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

(Optional) Use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Usage Examples

Each example shows how to use a model via Hugging Face pipelines.

### Text Generation

```bash
python simpleMain.py \
  --Topic: 
  --Age: 
```

### Text Summarizer + Question answering

```bash
python complexMain.py \
  --Enter text to summarize: 
  --Enter the length (short/medium/long):
  --Ask a question about the summary (or type 'exit' to stop)

```

## ðŸ”§ Customization

You can change model identifiers to any compatible Hugging Face model, such as:

* `"facebook/bart-large-cnn"` for summarization
* `"facebook/bart-large"` for refinement
* `"deepset/roberta-base-squad2"` for question answering 
* * `"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1"` for text generation
